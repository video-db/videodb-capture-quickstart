## Installation (Pre-built App)

If you downloaded the pre-built app from the link above:

1. **Mount the DMG** and drag VideoDB Focusd to your Applications folder

2. **Remove quarantine attributes** to allow the app to run:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/VideoDB\ Focusd.app
   ```

3. **Launch the app** from Applications or Spotlight

4. **Grant system permissions** when prompted (Screen Recording is required)

## Overview

Focusd records your screen and system audio using VideoDB's real-time capture SDK. It uses vision models to understand what's on your screen every few seconds — which app you're in, what you're reading, what you're coding — and builds a layered summarization pipeline on top of that.

At any point during the day you can:

- See a **live activity timeline** showing what you've been doing and when
- Get **AI-generated session summaries** that tell you exactly what you worked on
- Drill down into any time range for a **detailed breakdown** with app usage, project time, and context
- View a **dashboard** with tracked time, productive time, top applications, and projects
- Generate an **end-of-day recap** with highlights and actionable improvement suggestions

## Architecture

## How summarization works

Raw screen captures flow through a 5-layer pipeline:

1. **Raw events** — VideoDB indexes your screen every few seconds, extracting app names, page titles, visible content
2. **Activity segments** — Events are grouped into time-based chunks
3. **Micro-summaries** — Each segment is summarized by an LLM (what you did, which app, productive or not)
4. **Session summaries** — Micro-summaries roll up into session overviews with app stats and project breakdown
5. **Daily summary** — Everything consolidates into a headline, highlights, and suggestions

All LLM prompts, pipeline timings, and indexing configs live in a single [`config.yaml`](config.yaml) file.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: macOS 12+ (Apple Silicon or Intel)
- **Node.js**: 18 or higher
- **npm**: 10 or higher
- **VideoDB API Key**: Sign up at [console.videodb.io](https://console.videodb.io)

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/video-db/videodb-capture-quickstart.git
cd videodb-capture-quickstart/apps/electron/focusd-productivity-tracker

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Copy env template and add your VideoDB API key
cp .env.sample .env

# 4. Run in dev mode
npm run dev

# 5. Build macOS DMG
npm run package:mac
```

## Configuration

All prompts, timing intervals, and indexing parameters are in [`config.yaml`](config.yaml). Key settings:

- `pipeline.segment_flush_mins` — how often raw events are grouped into segments
- `pipeline.micro_summary_mins` — how often segments get summarized
- `pipeline.session_summary_mins` — how often session-level summaries are generated
- `pipeline.idle_threshold_mins` — inactivity threshold before pausing tracking

These can also be adjusted from the **Settings** page in the app.

## Permissions (macOS)

The app requires the following system permissions:
- **Screen Recording** - For screen capture
- **System Audio Recording** - For capturing system audio (optional)

Grant these in **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording**.

## Troubleshooting

### Recording not starting
- Verify VideoDB API key is configured in Settings
- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (requires 18+)
- Grant screen recording permissions in System Settings

### No summaries appearing
- Wait for the first segment flush interval (default: 5 minutes)
- Check that screen indexing is active in the timeline
- Verify your API key has sufficient credits

### App won't launch
- Check for native module issues: `npm run rebuild`
- Delete app data and restart: `rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/VideoDB\ Focusd/`
- Review logs in `~/Library/Application Support/VideoDB Focusd/logs/`

### High CPU usage
- Increase `pipeline.segment_flush_mins` in Settings to reduce indexing frequency
- Disable system audio recording if not needed
- Close other screen recording apps that may conflict

## Data & Privacy

Screen captures are processed through VideoDB's API, and summaries are stored in a local SQLite database at `~/Library/Application Support/VideoDB Focusd/`. Your API key is encrypted using macOS Keychain via Electron's `safeStorage`.

To reset all data:

```
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/VideoDB\ Focusd/
```
